## Installation

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or later) and npm (version 7.x or later) installed on your machine.
- Yarn package manager (version 1.x) installed globally.

### Clone the Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Change to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karthickthankyou/multiverse-full-stack
   ```

### Install Dependencies

1. Change to the project root directory:

   ```bash
   cd multiverse-full-stack
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Start the Applications

The project consists of multiple applications. Follow the instructions below to start each application:

1. **Run Database Locally (`apps/api`):**
   We use postgres and meilisearch databases.

   ```bash
   cd apps/api

   docker compose up
   ```

2. **API Application (`apps/api`):**

   ```bash
   yarn workspace apps/api start:dev
   ```

3. **Web Application (`apps/web`):**

   ```bash
   yarn workspace apps/web dev
   ```

4. **Writer Web Application (`apps/writer-web`):**

   ```bash
   yarn workspace apps/writer-web dev
   ```

5. **Multiverse Mobile Application (`standalone-projects/multiverse-mobile`):**
   I built the react native project out of the yarn workspace due to some isses related metro not being supportive with the monorepos. This might be fixed later.

   ```bash
   cd standalone-projects/multiverse-mobile

   yarn install
   yarn start
   ```

### Access the Applications

Once the applications have started, you can access them in your web browser:

- API Application: The API will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Web Application: Open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser.
- Writer Web Application: Open `http://localhost:3002` in your browser.
- Multiverse Mobile Application: Follow the instructions provided in the project documentation for accessing the mobile application.

Make sure to check the project documentation for any additional configuration or setup required for specific applications or libraries.

## Architecture

This project follows a monorepo structure using Yarn and Nx, which enables sharing common libraries and code between the different applications within the project.

The monorepo is structured as follows:

- **apps/web**: The web application built with React and Next.js. It provides a user interface for interacting with the text adventure stories.

- **apps/writer-web**: The web-based writer application, also built with React and Next.js. It allows writers to create and extend text adventure stories, as well as manage story branches and choices.

- **apps/api**: The backend API implemented using NestJS. It serves as the central hub for managing user accounts, stories, and other data.

- **standalone-projects/multiverse-mobile**: A standalone React Native application for mobile devices. Due to the unique requirements and limitations of React Native's Metro bundler, it is kept separate from the monorepo to ensure smooth development and build processes.

By adopting a monorepo approach, the project leverages code reuse and maintainability across the different applications. It enables shared libraries, configurations, and development tooling, enhancing productivity and reducing duplication.
